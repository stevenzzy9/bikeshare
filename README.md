Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
This Python script is written for Project of Udacity and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

How to run the script
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. To install Spyder, you will need to download the Anaconda installer. This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Spyder IDE by opening Anaconda Navigator.

Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students of DAND. Under the permission of Udacity, I have uploaded a copy of the datasets here. The file sizes are too big to be uploaded on GitHub, so they were uploaded on Google Drive instead. After downloading the datasets, place them in the same folder with this Python script.

The data is provided by Motivate, which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration (in seconds)
Start Station
End Station
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

Future scopes
In the future, more functions that compute statistics will be added to answer more questions about the data. The possibilities of improving the interactive experience (e.g turning this script into a web app) will also be explored.
